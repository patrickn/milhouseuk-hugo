This site has been generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) using the [Minimal theme](https://github.com/calintat/minimal), and stored publicly here on Github. Updates are done on the go using a Git client, changes are then uploaded to Github where a [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) job generates the site and deploys to Amazon S3.

The S3 site is behind Amazons CloudFront CDN.
